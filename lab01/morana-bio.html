        Hi! My name is Anthony Morana. I’m currently a senior, majoring in information management & technology. I’m incredibly interested in how technology and finance intersect and plan to work as an analyst upon graduation. This past summer I had a technology internship at a small law firm. Outside of school and work I’m very passionate about health and fitness. I love going to the gym, I go at least 6 days a week, and have been for almost 5 years.
